## Add sound

--- task ---

Test your project a few times. Do you notice that sometimes the same number is chosen twice (or more) in a row, which makes the sequence harder to memorise?

--- /task ---

Can you make a drum sound play each time the character sprite changes costume? And how about a different drum sound for each colour? 

--- task ---

Add the Music extension to your project so you can use the `play drum`{:class="block3extensions"} block.

[[[generic-scratch3-add-music-extension]]]

--- /task ---

The code that plays the drum is __very__ similar to the code that changes the character's costume.

You only need to add two blocks: a `play drum for (0.25) beats`{:class="block3sound"} block and a `item (length of sequence) of sequence`{:class="block3variables"} block.

Here are the blocks you need:

![ballerina](images/ballerina.png)

```blocks3
play drum (\(1\) Snare Drum v) for (0.25) beats

(item (length of [sequence v]) of [sequence v])
```
--- /hint ---

--- hint ---
Here is how your finished code should look:

![ballerina](images/ballerina.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
delete (all v) of [sequence v]
repeat (5)
	add (pick random (1) to (4)) to [sequence v]
    play drum (item (length of [sequence v]) of [sequence v]) for (0.25) beats
    switch costume to (item (length of [sequence v]) of [sequence v])
    wait (1) seconds
end
```
